## Education
- B.E., Electronics and Communication | KLE Technological University at Hubli (_August 2016 - June 2020_)

## Industrial Experience
**Software Engineer @ Toshiba Software India Pvt Ltd (_August 2020 - Present_)**
- Managed the design and implementation of a test suite to validate both backend and frontend modules and
the behavior of the NVMe Management endpoint and NVMe Controller Management over interfaces such as
SMBus and I2C for NVMe Data-Centric SSDs.
- Conducted performance validation, regression testing, data integrity testing, implemented stress scenarios and
performed failure analysis to validate firmware stability.

**Machine Learning Intern @ MulticoreWare (_January 2020 - June 2020_)**
- Designed an end to end analytics pipeline and delivered a comprehensive visual suite for pedestrian tracking,
catering to both street surveillance and customer analytics in indoor malls.
- Achieved multi-object tracking accuracy(MOTA) of over 90% on low density test video clips and over 24% on
highly complex, high density test video clips.

## Research Experience
**Project Trainee @ Samsung Research Institute(_August 2018 - May 2019_)**
- Collaborated with the Samsung R&D Institute India-Bangalore (SRIB) on the project tilted
’Crypto-Nets:Neural Networks over Encrypted Data’ to develop and implement machine learning models
capable of training on encrypted data to enhance data privacy and security while still enabling advanced
machine learning applications.
- Experimented with different homomorphic encryption schemes such as Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan
(BGV) and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) to encrypt images. Utilized Microsoft’s SEAL library to
implement BGV and CKKS schemes.
- Proposed an alternative way of achieving homomorphic data encryption by using autoencoders. Classified
encrypted data using a custom CNN and achieved 70% accuracy on CIFAR 10 dataset.

**Summer Intern @ Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (_June 2018 - July 2018_)**
- Worked under Professor Prem Kalra on the project titled ‘Linguistic Indexing and Automatic Evaluation of
Crowdsourced Data’
- Designed an image annotation and processing pipeline for the crowdsourced heritage site dataset(temples) for
the digital museum project.
- Trained and fine-tuned YOLOv3 and MobileNet models to caption Dravidan temples. Scaled the model to
recognize and caption different temple architectures.

## Projects
### Pedestrian Tracking and Analytics
- Integrated YOLOv4(trained on MOT17 and MOT20) and DeepSort tracker to deliver visual analytics like
pedestrain track trajectory, motion heatmap and social distancing violation check.
- Improved the baseline MOTA by replacing DeepSort’s custom CNN with AlignedReID and utilizing low
confidence track filter and a novel ’last seen area’ filter. Deployed the model in indoor malls during COVID in
2020.
- Outperformed the state-of-the-art DeepSort tracker, improving multi-object tracking accuracy and
multi-object tracking precision by 3%.

### Behaviorial Biometrics based User Authentication
- Developed a custom deep learning model to recognize and distinguish behavioral biometrics, specifically
pick-up trajectories, of a smartphone user for authentication.
- Developed an Android app to collect data from over 100 users. Prepped and processed complex spatial
temporal data from both calibrated and uncalibrated sensors by performing Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Trained and fine-tuned customized LeNet architecture on prepped dataset and achieved a rank 3 accuracy of
73%.
